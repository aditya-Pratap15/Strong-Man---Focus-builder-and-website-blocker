- **Mindful Intervention:** Overlays a blurred focus screen with personal goals and a breathing exercise.
- **Deep-Work Cooldown:** Temporarily restricts access to distracting sites to strengthen the prefrontal cortex.
- **Privacy First:** All processing happens locally on your device.

## 🛠️ Technical Stack

## 🛡️ The "Strong Man" Philosophy
This tool is not just a blocker; it is a trainer. By forcing a 5-minute pause and a breathing exercise, it helps transition the brain from the limbic system (instinct) to the prefrontal cortex (logic).
